    - {{ compiler('c') }}                    # [not win] NB on windows this would activate Visual Studio and make that the default C/C++ compiler

    - {{ stdlib("c") }}                      # [not win] on Windows this pulls in VS and causes cmake to use its cl.exe, which is incompatible with the m2w64 version of windres.exe
