    - cross-python_{{ target_platform }}     # [build_platform != target_platform]

    - numpy                                  # [build_platform != target_platform]
    - cmake
    - make                                   # [not win]
    - {{ compiler('c') }}                    # [not win] NB on windows this would activate Visual Studio and make that the default C/C++ compiler
    - {{ compiler('fortran') }}              # [not win]
    - {{ stdlib("c") }}                      # [not win] on Windows this pulls in VS and causes cmake to use its cl.exe, which is incompatible with the m2w64 version of windres.exe
